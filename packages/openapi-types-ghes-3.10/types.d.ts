     * Creates OAuth tokens using [Basic Authentication](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/rest/authentication/authenticating-to-the-rest-api#using-basic-authentication). If you have two-factor authentication setup, Basic Authentication for this endpoint requires that you use a one-time password (OTP) and your username and password instead of tokens. For more information, see "[Working with two-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/rest/overview/other-authentication-methods#working-with-two-factor-authentication)."
     *
     * To create tokens for a particular OAuth application using this endpoint, you must authenticate as the user you want to create an authorization for and provide the app's client ID and secret, found on your OAuth application's settings page. If your OAuth application intends to create multiple tokens for one user, use `fingerprint` to differentiate between them.
     *
     * You can also create tokens on GitHub Enterprise Server from the [personal access tokens settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens) page. Read more about these tokens in [the GitHub Help documentation](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use).
     *
     * Organizations that enforce SAML SSO require personal access tokens to be allowed. For more information, see "[About identity and access management with SAML single sign-on](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/managing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization/about-identity-and-access-management-with-saml-single-sign-on)" in the GitHub Enterprise Cloud documentation.

     * * The `core` object provides your rate limit status for all non-search-related resources in the REST API.
     * * The `search` object provides your rate limit status for the REST API for searching (excluding code searches). For more information, see "[Search](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/rest/search/search)."
     * * The `code_search` object provides your rate limit status for the REST API for searching code. For more information, see "[Search code](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/rest/search/search#search-code)."
     * * The `graphql` object provides your rate limit status for the GraphQL API. For more information, see "[Resource limitations](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/graphql/overview/resource-limitations#rate-limit)."
     * * The `integration_manifest` object provides your rate limit status for the `POST /app-manifests/{code}/conversions` operation. For more information, see "[Creating a GitHub App from a manifest](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/apps/creating-github-apps/setting-up-a-github-app/creating-a-github-app-from-a-manifest#3-you-exchange-the-temporary-code-to-retrieve-the-app-configuration)."
     * * The `dependency_snapshots` object provides your rate limit status for submitting snapshots to the dependency graph. For more information, see "[Dependency graph](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/rest/dependency-graph)."
     * * The `code_scanning_upload` object provides your rate limit status for uploading SARIF results to code scanning. For more information, see "[Uploading a SARIF file to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-scanning/uploading-a-sarif-file-to-github)."
     * * The `actions_runner_registration` object provides your rate limit status for registering self-hosted runners in GitHub Actions. For more information, see "[Self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/rest/actions/self-hosted-runners)."

     * Delete a code scanning analysis from a repository
     * @description Deletes a specified code scanning analysis from a repository.
     *
     * You can delete one analysis at a time.
     * To delete a series of analyses, start with the most recent analysis and work backwards.
     * Conceptually, the process is similar to the undo function in a text editor.
     *
     * When you list the analyses for a repository,
     * one or more will be identified as deletable in the response:
     *
     * ```
     * "deletable": true
     * ```
     *
     * An analysis is deletable when it's the most recent in a set of analyses.
     * Typically, a repository will have multiple sets of analyses
     * for each enabled code scanning tool,
     * where a set is determined by a unique combination of analysis values:
     *
     * * `ref`
     * * `tool`
     * * `category`
     *
     * If you attempt to delete an analysis that is not the most recent in a set,
     * you'll get a 400 response with the message:
     *
     * ```
     * Analysis specified is not deletable.
     * ```
     *
     * The response from a successful `DELETE` operation provides you with
     * two alternative URLs for deleting the next analysis in the set:
     * `next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url`.
     * Use the `next_analysis_url` URL if you want to avoid accidentally deleting the final analysis
     * in a set. This is a useful option if you want to preserve at least one analysis
     * for the specified tool in your repository.
     * Use the `confirm_delete_url` URL if you are content to remove all analyses for a tool.
     * When you delete the last analysis in a set, the value of `next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url`
     * in the 200 response is `null`.
     *
     * As an example of the deletion process,
     * let's imagine that you added a workflow that configured a particular code scanning tool
     * to analyze the code in a repository. This tool has added 15 analyses:
     * 10 on the default branch, and another 5 on a topic branch.
     * You therefore have two separate sets of analyses for this tool.
     * You've now decided that you want to remove all of the analyses for the tool.
     * To do this you must make 15 separate deletion requests.
     * To start, you must find an analysis that's identified as deletable.
     * Each set of analyses always has one that's identified as deletable.
     * Having found the deletable analysis for one of the two sets,
     * delete this analysis and then continue deleting the next analysis in the set until they're all deleted.
     * Then repeat the process for the second set.
     * The procedure therefore consists of a nested loop:
     *
     * **Outer loop**:
     * * List the analyses for the repository, filtered by tool.
     * * Parse this list to find a deletable analysis. If found:
     *
     *   **Inner loop**:
     *   * Delete the identified analysis.
     *   * Parse the response for the value of `confirm_delete_url` and, if found, use this in the next iteration.
     *
     * The above process assumes that you want to remove all trace of the tool's analyses from the GitHub user interface, for the specified repository, and it therefore uses the `confirm_delete_url` value. Alternatively, you could use the `next_analysis_url` value, which would leave the last analysis in each set undeleted to avoid removing a tool's analysis entirely.

     *
     * There are two places where you can upload code scanning results.
     *  - If you upload to a pull request, for example `--ref refs/pull/42/merge` or `--ref refs/pull/42/head`, then the results appear as alerts in a pull request check. For more information, see "[Triaging code scanning alerts in pull requests](/code-security/secure-coding/triaging-code-scanning-alerts-in-pull-requests)."

     *
     * SARIF upload supports a maximum number of entries per the following data objects, and an analysis will be rejected if any of these objects is above its maximum value. For some objects, there are additional values over which the entries will be ignored while keeping the most important entries whenever applicable.
     * To get the most out of your analysis when it includes data above the supported limits, try to optimize the analysis configuration. For example, for the CodeQL tool, identify and remove the most noisy queries.

     *
     * If the content is a directory, the response will be an array of objects, one object for each item in the directory. When listing the contents of a directory, submodules have their "type" specified as "file". Logically, the value _should_ be "submodule". This behavior exists [for backwards compatibility purposes](https://git.io/v1YCW). In the next major version of the API, the type will be returned as "submodule".
     *
     * If the content is a symlink and the symlink's target is a normal file in the repository, then the API responds with the content of the file. Otherwise, the API responds with an object describing the symlink itself.
     *
     * If the content is a submodule, the `submodule_git_url` field identifies the location of the submodule repository, and the `sha` identifies a specific commit within the submodule repository. Git uses the given URL when cloning the submodule repository, and checks out the submodule at that specific commit. If the submodule repository is not hosted on github.com, the Git URLs (`git_url` and `_links["git"]`) and the github.com URLs (`html_url` and `_links["html"]`) will have null values.

     * @description Deployments offer a few configurable parameters with certain defaults.
     *
     * The `ref` parameter can be any named branch, tag, or SHA. At GitHub Enterprise Server we often deploy branches and verify them
     * before we merge a pull request.
     *
     * The `environment` parameter allows deployments to be issued to different runtime environments. Teams often have
     * multiple environments for verifying their applications, such as `production`, `staging`, and `qa`. This parameter
     * makes it easier to track which environments have requested deployments. The default environment is `production`.
     *
     * The `auto_merge` parameter is used to ensure that the requested ref is not behind the repository's default branch. If
     * the ref _is_ behind the default branch for the repository, we will attempt to merge it for you. If the merge succeeds,
     * the API will return a successful merge commit. If merge conflicts prevent the merge from succeeding, the API will
     * return a failure response.
     *
     * By default, [commit statuses](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/rest/commits/statuses) for every submitted context must be in a `success`
     * state. The `required_contexts` parameter allows you to specify a subset of contexts that must be `success`, or to
     * specify contexts that have not yet been submitted. You are not required to use commit statuses to deploy. If you do
     * not require any contexts or create any commit statuses, the deployment will always succeed.
     *
     * The `payload` parameter is available for any extra information that a deployment system might need. It is a JSON text
     * field that will be passed on when a deployment event is dispatched.
     *
     * The `task` parameter is used by the deployment system to allow different execution paths. In the web world this might
     * be `deploy:migrations` to run schema changes on the system. In the compiled world this could be a flag to compile an
     * application with debugging enabled.
     *
     * Merged branch response:
     *
     * You will see this response when GitHub automatically merges the base branch into the topic branch instead of creating
     * a deployment. This auto-merge happens when:
     * *   Auto-merge option is enabled in the repository
     * *   Topic branch does not include the latest changes on the base branch, which is `master` in the response example
     * *   There are no merge conflicts
     *
     * If there are no new commits in the base branch, a new request to create a deployment should give a successful
     * response.
     *
     * Merge conflict response:
     *
     * This error happens when the `auto_merge` option is enabled and when the default branch (in this case `master`), can't
     * be merged into the branch that's being deployed (in this case `topic-branch`), due to merge conflicts.
     *
     * Failed commit status checks:
     *
     * This error happens when the `required_contexts` parameter indicates that one or more contexts need to have a `success`
     * status for the commit to be deployed, but one or more of the required contexts do not have a state of `success`.
     *
     * OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` or `repo_deployment` scope to use this endpoint.

You can identify pull requests by the `pull_request` key. Be aware that the `id` of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an _issue id_. To find out the pull request id, use the "[List pull requests](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/rest/pulls/pulls#list-pull-requests)" endpoint.

This test commit is not added to the base branch or the head branch. You can review the status of the test commit using the `mergeable` key. For more information, see "[Checking mergeability of pull requests](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-git-database-api#checking-mergeability-of-pull-requests)".

     * The value of the `mergeable` attribute can be `true`, `false`, or `null`. If the value is `null`, then GitHub Enterprise Server has started a background job to compute the mergeability. After giving the job time to complete, resubmit the request. When the job finishes, you will see a non-`null` value for the `mergeable` attribute in the response. If `mergeable` is `true`, then `merge_commit_sha` will be the SHA of the _test_ merge commit.
     *
     * The value of the `merge_commit_sha` attribute changes depending on the state of the pull request. Before merging a pull request, the `merge_commit_sha` attribute holds the SHA of the _test_ merge commit. After merging a pull request, the `merge_commit_sha` attribute changes depending on how you merged the pull request:
     *
     * *   If merged as a [merge commit](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/), `merge_commit_sha` represents the SHA of the merge commit.
     * *   If merged via a [squash](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/#squashing-your-merge-commits), `merge_commit_sha` represents the SHA of the squashed commit on the base branch.
     * *   If [rebased](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/#rebasing-and-merging-your-commits), `merge_commit_sha` represents the commit that the base branch was updated to.

     *
     * `application/zip`

     * When an upstream failure occurs, you will receive a `502 Bad Gateway` status. This may leave an empty asset with a state of `starter`. It can be safely deleted.
     *
     * **Notes:**
     * *   GitHub Enterprise Server renames asset filenames that have special characters, non-alphanumeric characters, and leading or trailing periods. The "[List release assets](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/rest/releases/assets#list-release-assets)"

     * Compare two commits
     * @description **Deprecated**: Use `repos.compareCommitsWithBasehead()` (`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/compare/{basehead}`) instead. Both `:base` and `:head` must be branch names in `:repo`. To compare branches across other repositories in the same network as `:repo`, use the format `<USERNAME>:branch`.
     *
     * The response from the API is equivalent to running the `git log base..head` command; however, commits are returned in chronological order. Pass the appropriate [media type](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/media-types/#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests) to fetch diff and patch formats.
     *
     * The response also includes details on the files that were changed between the two commits. This includes the status of the change (for example, if a file was added, removed, modified, or renamed), and details of the change itself. For example, files with a `renamed` status have a `previous_filename` field showing the previous filename of the file, and files with a `modified` status have a `patch` field showing the changes made to the file.
     *
     * **Working with large comparisons**
     *
     * To process a response with a large number of commits, you can use (`per_page` or `page`) to paginate the results. When using paging, the list of changed files is only returned with page 1, but includes all changed files for the entire comparison. For more information on working with pagination, see "[Traversing with pagination](/rest/guides/traversing-with-pagination)."
     *
     * When calling this API without any paging parameters (`per_page` or `page`), the returned list is limited to 250 commits and the last commit in the list is the most recent of the entire comparison. When a paging parameter is specified, the first commit in the returned list of each page is the earliest.
     *
     * **Signature verification object**
     *
     * The response will include a `verification` object that describes the result of verifying the commit's signature. The following fields are included in the `verification` object:
     *
     * | Name | Type | Description |
     * | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
     * | `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the signature in this commit to be verified. |
     * | `reason` | `string` | The reason for verified value. Possible values and their meanings are enumerated in table below. |
     * | `signature` | `string` | The signature that was extracted from the commit. |
     * | `payload` | `string` | The value that was signed. |
     *
     * These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:
     *
     * | Value | Description |
     * | ----- | ----------- |
     * | `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. |
     * | `not_signing_key` | The "signing" flag is not among the usage flags in the GPG key that made the signature. |
     * | `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with the signature verification service. |
     * | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is currently unavailable. |
     * | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. |
     * | `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in the commit. |
     * | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address in the commit. |
     * | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on her/his account. |
     * | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. |
     * | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been registered with any user's account. |
     * | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. |
     * | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. |
     * | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is considered to be verified. |

       * @example # Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
       *
       * ## Our Pledge
       *
       * In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
       *
       * ## Our Standards
       *
       * Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:
       *
       * * Using welcoming and inclusive language
       * * Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
       * * Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
       * * Focusing on what is best for the community
       * * Showing empathy towards other community members
       *
       * Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
       *
       * * The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
       * * Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
       * * Public or private harassment
       * * Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
       * * Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
       *
       * ## Our Responsibilities
       *
       * Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response
       *                   to any instances of unacceptable behavior.
       *
       * Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
       *
       * ## Scope
       *
       * This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address,
       *                   posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
       *
       * ## Enforcement
       *
       * Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [EMAIL]. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
       *
       * Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
       *
       * ## Attribution
       *
       * This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org), version 1.4, available at [http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/).

   * This method will create a new authorization for the specified OAuth application, only if an authorization for that application and fingerprint do not already exist for the user. The URL includes the 20 character client ID for the OAuth app that is requesting the token. `fingerprint` is a unique string to distinguish an authorization from others created for the same client ID and user. It returns the user's existing authorization for the application if one is present. Otherwise, it creates and returns a new one.

   * Some categories of endpoints have custom rate limits that are separate from the rate limit governing the other REST API endpoints. For this reason, the API response categorizes your rate limit. Under `resources`, you'll see objects relating to different categories:
   * * The `core` object provides your rate limit status for all non-search-related resources in the REST API.
   * * The `search` object provides your rate limit status for the REST API for searching (excluding code searches). For more information, see "[Search](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/rest/search/search)."
   * * The `code_search` object provides your rate limit status for the REST API for searching code. For more information, see "[Search code](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/rest/search/search#search-code)."
   * * The `graphql` object provides your rate limit status for the GraphQL API. For more information, see "[Resource limitations](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/graphql/overview/resource-limitations#rate-limit)."
   * * The `integration_manifest` object provides your rate limit status for the `POST /app-manifests/{code}/conversions` operation. For more information, see "[Creating a GitHub App from a manifest](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/apps/creating-github-apps/setting-up-a-github-app/creating-a-github-app-from-a-manifest#3-you-exchange-the-temporary-code-to-retrieve-the-app-configuration)."
   * * The `dependency_snapshots` object provides your rate limit status for submitting snapshots to the dependency graph. For more information, see "[Dependency graph](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/rest/dependency-graph)."
   * * The `code_scanning_upload` object provides your rate limit status for uploading SARIF results to code scanning. For more information, see "[Uploading a SARIF file to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-scanning/uploading-a-sarif-file-to-github)."
   * * The `actions_runner_registration` object provides your rate limit status for registering self-hosted runners in GitHub Actions. For more information, see "[Self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/rest/actions/self-hosted-runners)."
   * * The `source_import` object is no longer in use for any API endpoints, and it will be removed in the next API version. For more information about API versions, see "[API Versions](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/rest/about-the-rest-api/api-versions)."

  /**
   * Delete a code scanning analysis from a repository
   * @description Deletes a specified code scanning analysis from a repository.
   *
   * You can delete one analysis at a time.
   * To delete a series of analyses, start with the most recent analysis and work backwards.
   * Conceptually, the process is similar to the undo function in a text editor.
   *
   * When you list the analyses for a repository,
   * one or more will be identified as deletable in the response:
   *
   * ```
   * "deletable": true
   * ```
   *
   * An analysis is deletable when it's the most recent in a set of analyses.
   * Typically, a repository will have multiple sets of analyses
   * for each enabled code scanning tool,
   * where a set is determined by a unique combination of analysis values:
   *
   * * `ref`
   * * `tool`
   * * `category`
   *
   * If you attempt to delete an analysis that is not the most recent in a set,
   * you'll get a 400 response with the message:
   *
   * ```
   * Analysis specified is not deletable.
   * ```
   *
   * The response from a successful `DELETE` operation provides you with
   * two alternative URLs for deleting the next analysis in the set:
   * `next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url`.
   * Use the `next_analysis_url` URL if you want to avoid accidentally deleting the final analysis
   * in a set. This is a useful option if you want to preserve at least one analysis
   * for the specified tool in your repository.
   * Use the `confirm_delete_url` URL if you are content to remove all analyses for a tool.
   * When you delete the last analysis in a set, the value of `next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url`
   * in the 200 response is `null`.
   *
   * As an example of the deletion process,
   * let's imagine that you added a workflow that configured a particular code scanning tool
   * to analyze the code in a repository. This tool has added 15 analyses:
   * 10 on the default branch, and another 5 on a topic branch.
   * You therefore have two separate sets of analyses for this tool.
   * You've now decided that you want to remove all of the analyses for the tool.
   * To do this you must make 15 separate deletion requests.
   * To start, you must find an analysis that's identified as deletable.
   * Each set of analyses always has one that's identified as deletable.
   * Having found the deletable analysis for one of the two sets,
   * delete this analysis and then continue deleting the next analysis in the set until they're all deleted.
   * Then repeat the process for the second set.
   * The procedure therefore consists of a nested loop:
   *
   * **Outer loop**:
   * * List the analyses for the repository, filtered by tool.
   * * Parse this list to find a deletable analysis. If found:
   *
   *   **Inner loop**:
   *   * Delete the identified analysis.
   *   * Parse the response for the value of `confirm_delete_url` and, if found, use this in the next iteration.
   *
   * The above process assumes that you want to remove all trace of the tool's analyses from the GitHub user interface, for the specified repository, and it therefore uses the `confirm_delete_url` value. Alternatively, you could use the `next_analysis_url` value, which would leave the last analysis in each set undeleted to avoid removing a tool's analysis entirely.
   *
   * OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint with private or public repositories, or the `public_repo` scope to use this endpoint with only public repositories.

   * @description Uploads SARIF data containing the results of a code scanning analysis to make the results available in a repository. For troubleshooting information, see "[Troubleshooting SARIF uploads](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/code-security/code-scanning/troubleshooting-sarif)."
   *
   * There are two places where you can upload code scanning results.
   *  - If you upload to a pull request, for example `--ref refs/pull/42/merge` or `--ref refs/pull/42/head`, then the results appear as alerts in a pull request check. For more information, see "[Triaging code scanning alerts in pull requests](/code-security/secure-coding/triaging-code-scanning-alerts-in-pull-requests)."
   *  - If you upload to a branch, for example `--ref refs/heads/my-branch`, then the results appear in the **Security** tab for your repository. For more information, see "[Managing code scanning alerts for your repository](/code-security/secure-coding/managing-code-scanning-alerts-for-your-repository#viewing-the-alerts-for-a-repository)."
   *
   * You must compress the SARIF-formatted analysis data that you want to upload, using `gzip`, and then encode it as a Base64 format string. For example:
   *
   * ```
   * gzip -c analysis-data.sarif | base64 -w0
   * ```
   *
   * SARIF upload supports a maximum number of entries per the following data objects, and an analysis will be rejected if any of these objects is above its maximum value. For some objects, there are additional values over which the entries will be ignored while keeping the most important entries whenever applicable.
   * To get the most out of your analysis when it includes data above the supported limits, try to optimize the analysis configuration. For example, for the CodeQL tool, identify and remove the most noisy queries. For more information, see "[SARIF results exceed one or more limits](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/code-security/code-scanning/troubleshooting-sarif/results-exceed-limit)."

   * The `202 Accepted` response includes an `id` value.
   * You can use this ID to check the status of the upload by using it in the `/sarifs/{sarif_id}` endpoint.

  /**
   * Compare two commits
   * @description Compares two commits against one another. You can compare refs (branches or tags) and commit SHAs in the same repository, or you can compare refs and commit SHAs that exist in different repositories within the same repository network, including fork branches. For more information about how to view a repository's network, see "[Understanding connections between repositories](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/repositories/viewing-activity-and-data-for-your-repository/understanding-connections-between-repositories)."
   *
   * This endpoint is equivalent to running the `git log BASE..HEAD` command, but it returns commits in a different order. The `git log BASE..HEAD` command returns commits in reverse chronological order, whereas the API returns commits in chronological order.
   *
   * This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "[Media types](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."
   *
   * - **`application/vnd.github.diff`**: Returns the diff of the commit.
   * - **`application/vnd.github.patch`**: Returns the patch of the commit. Diffs with binary data will have no `patch` property.
   *
   * The API response includes details about the files that were changed between the two commits. This includes the status of the change (if a file was added, removed, modified, or renamed), and details of the change itself. For example, files with a `renamed` status have a `previous_filename` field showing the previous filename of the file, and files with a `modified` status have a `patch` field showing the changes made to the file.
   *
   * When calling this endpoint without any paging parameter (`per_page` or `page`), the returned list is limited to 250 commits, and the last commit in the list is the most recent of the entire comparison.
   *
   * **Working with large comparisons**
   *
   * To process a response with a large number of commits, use a query parameter (`per_page` or `page`) to paginate the results. When using pagination:
   *
   * - The list of changed files is only shown on the first page of results, and it includes up to 300 changed files for the entire comparison.
   * - The results are returned in chronological order, but the last commit in the returned list may not be the most recent one in the entire set if there are more pages of results.
   *
   * For more information on working with pagination, see "[Using pagination in the REST API](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/rest/guides/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api)."
   *
   * **Signature verification object**
   *
   * The response will include a `verification` object that describes the result of verifying the commit's signature. The `verification` object includes the following fields:
   *
   * | Name | Type | Description |
   * | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
   * | `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the signature in this commit to be verified. |
   * | `reason` | `string` | The reason for verified value. Possible values and their meanings are enumerated in table below. |
   * | `signature` | `string` | The signature that was extracted from the commit. |
   * | `payload` | `string` | The value that was signed. |
   * | `verified_at` | `string` | The date the signature was verified by GitHub. |
   *
   * These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:
   *
   * | Value | Description |
   * | ----- | ----------- |
   * | `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. |
   * | `not_signing_key` | The "signing" flag is not among the usage flags in the GPG key that made the signature. |
   * | `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with the signature verification service. |
   * | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is currently unavailable. |
   * | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. |
   * | `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in the commit. |
   * | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address in the commit. |
   * | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on their account. |
   * | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. |
   * | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been registered with any user's account. |
   * | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. |
   * | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. |
   * | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is considered to be verified. |

   *
   * This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "[Media types](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."
   *
   * - **`application/vnd.github.raw+json`**: Returns the raw file contents for files and symlinks.
   * - **`application/vnd.github.html+json`**: Returns the file contents in HTML. Markup languages are rendered to HTML using GitHub's open-source [Markup library](https://github.com/github/markup).
   * - **`application/vnd.github.object+json`**: Returns the contents in a consistent object format regardless of the content type. For example, instead of an array of objects for a directory, the response will be an object with an `entries` attribute containing the array of objects.
   *
   * If the content is a directory, the response will be an array of objects, one object for each item in the directory. When listing the contents of a directory, submodules have their "type" specified as "file". Logically, the value _should_ be "submodule". This behavior exists [for backwards compatibility purposes](https://git.io/v1YCW). In the next major version of the API, the type will be returned as "submodule".
   *
   * If the content is a symlink and the symlink's target is a normal file in the repository, then the API responds with the content of the file. Otherwise, the API responds with an object describing the symlink itself.
   *
   * If the content is a submodule, the `submodule_git_url` field identifies the location of the submodule repository, and the `sha` identifies a specific commit within the submodule repository. Git uses the given URL when cloning the submodule repository, and checks out the submodule at that specific commit. If the submodule repository is not hosted on github.com, the Git URLs (`git_url` and `_links["git"]`) and the github.com URLs (`html_url` and `_links["html"]`) will have null values.
   *
   * **Notes**:
   *
   * - To get a repository's contents recursively, you can [recursively get the tree](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/rest/git/trees#get-a-tree).
   * - This API has an upper limit of 1,000 files for a directory. If you need to retrieve
   * more files, use the [Git Trees API](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/rest/git/trees#get-a-tree).
   * - Download URLs expire and are meant to be used just once. To ensure the download URL does not expire, please use the contents API to obtain a fresh download URL for each download.
   * - If the requested file's size is:
   *   - 1 MB or smaller: All features of this endpoint are supported.
   *   - Between 1-100 MB: Only the `raw` or `object` custom media types are supported. Both will work as normal, except that when using the `object` media type, the `content` field will be an empty
   * string and the `encoding` field will be `"none"`. To get the contents of these larger files, use the `raw` media type.
   *   - Greater than 100 MB: This endpoint is not supported.

  /**
   * Create a deployment
   * @description Deployments offer a few configurable parameters with certain defaults.
   *
   * The `ref` parameter can be any named branch, tag, or SHA. At GitHub Enterprise Server we often deploy branches and verify them
   * before we merge a pull request.
   *
   * The `environment` parameter allows deployments to be issued to different runtime environments. Teams often have
   * multiple environments for verifying their applications, such as `production`, `staging`, and `qa`. This parameter
   * makes it easier to track which environments have requested deployments. The default environment is `production`.
   *
   * The `auto_merge` parameter is used to ensure that the requested ref is not behind the repository's default branch. If
   * the ref _is_ behind the default branch for the repository, we will attempt to merge it for you. If the merge succeeds,
   * the API will return a successful merge commit. If merge conflicts prevent the merge from succeeding, the API will
   * return a failure response.
   *
   * By default, [commit statuses](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/rest/commits/statuses) for every submitted context must be in a `success`
   * state. The `required_contexts` parameter allows you to specify a subset of contexts that must be `success`, or to
   * specify contexts that have not yet been submitted. You are not required to use commit statuses to deploy. If you do
   * not require any contexts or create any commit statuses, the deployment will always succeed.
   *
   * The `payload` parameter is available for any extra information that a deployment system might need. It is a JSON text
   * field that will be passed on when a deployment event is dispatched.
   *
   * The `task` parameter is used by the deployment system to allow different execution paths. In the web world this might
   * be `deploy:migrations` to run schema changes on the system. In the compiled world this could be a flag to compile an
   * application with debugging enabled.
   *
   * Merged branch response:
   *
   * You will see this response when GitHub automatically merges the base branch into the topic branch instead of creating
   * a deployment. This auto-merge happens when:
   * *   Auto-merge option is enabled in the repository
   * *   Topic branch does not include the latest changes on the base branch, which is `master` in the response example
   * *   There are no merge conflicts
   *
   * If there are no new commits in the base branch, a new request to create a deployment should give a successful
   * response.
   *
   * Merge conflict response:
   *
   * This error happens when the `auto_merge` option is enabled and when the default branch (in this case `master`), can't
   * be merged into the branch that's being deployed (in this case `topic-branch`), due to merge conflicts.
   *
   * Failed commit status checks:
   *
   * This error happens when the `required_contexts` parameter indicates that one or more contexts need to have a `success`
   * status for the commit to be deployed, but one or more of the required contexts do not have a state of `success`.
   *
   * OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` or `repo_deployment` scope to use this endpoint.

   * | Value | Description |
   * | ----- | ----------- |
   * | `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. |
   * | `not_signing_key` | The "signing" flag is not among the usage flags in the GPG key that made the signature. |
   * | `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with the signature verification service. |
   * | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is currently unavailable. |
   * | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. |
   * | `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in the commit. |
   * | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address in the commit. |
   * | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on their account. |
   * | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. |
   * | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been registered with any user's account. |
   * | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. |
   * | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. |
   * | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is considered to be verified. |

This test commit is not added to the base branch or the head branch. You can review the status of the test commit using the `mergeable` key. For more information, see "[Checking mergeability of pull requests](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-git-database-api#checking-mergeability-of-pull-requests)".
   *
   * The value of the `mergeable` attribute can be `true`, `false`, or `null`. If the value is `null`, then GitHub Enterprise Server has started a background job to compute the mergeability. After giving the job time to complete, resubmit the request. When the job finishes, you will see a non-`null` value for the `mergeable` attribute in the response. If `mergeable` is `true`, then `merge_commit_sha` will be the SHA of the _test_ merge commit.
   *
   * The value of the `merge_commit_sha` attribute changes depending on the state of the pull request. Before merging a pull request, the `merge_commit_sha` attribute holds the SHA of the _test_ merge commit. After merging a pull request, the `merge_commit_sha` attribute changes depending on how you merged the pull request:
   *
   * *   If merged as a [merge commit](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/), `merge_commit_sha` represents the SHA of the merge commit.
   * *   If merged via a [squash](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/#squashing-your-merge-commits), `merge_commit_sha` represents the SHA of the squashed commit on the base branch.
   * *   If [rebased](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/#rebasing-and-merging-your-commits), `merge_commit_sha` represents the commit that the base branch was updated to.

   * Upload a release asset
   * @description This endpoint makes use of a [Hypermedia relation](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#hypermedia) to determine which URL to access. The endpoint you call to upload release assets is specific to your release. Use the `upload_url` returned in
   * the response of the [Create a release endpoint](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/rest/releases/releases#create-a-release) to upload a release asset.
   *
   * You need to use an HTTP client which supports [SNI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) to make calls to this endpoint.
   *
   * Most libraries will set the required `Content-Length` header automatically. Use the required `Content-Type` header to provide the media type of the asset. For a list of media types, see [Media Types](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml). For example:
   *
   * `application/zip`
   *
   * GitHub Enterprise Server expects the asset data in its raw binary form, rather than JSON. You will send the raw binary content of the asset as the request body. Everything else about the endpoint is the same as the rest of the API. For example,
   * you'll still need to pass your authentication to be able to upload an asset.
   *
   * When an upstream failure occurs, you will receive a `502 Bad Gateway` status. This may leave an empty asset with a state of `starter`. It can be safely deleted.
   *
   * **Notes:**
   * *   GitHub Enterprise Server renames asset filenames that have special characters, non-alphanumeric characters, and leading or trailing periods. The "[List release assets](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/rest/releases/assets#list-release-assets)"
   * endpoint lists the renamed filenames. For more information and help, contact [GitHub Enterprise Server Support](https://support.github.com/contact?tags=dotcom-rest-api).
   * *   To find the `release_id` query the [`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/latest` endpoint](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/rest/releases/releases#get-the-latest-release).
   * *   If you upload an asset with the same filename as another uploaded asset, you'll receive an error and must delete the old file before you can re-upload the new asset.

   *
   * When searching for code, you can get text match metadata for the file **content** and file **path** fields when you pass the `text-match` media type. For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, see [Text match metadata](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/rest/search/search#text-match-metadata).
   *
   * For example, if you want to find the definition of the `addClass` function inside [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) repository, your query would look something like this:
   *
   * `q=addClass+in:file+language:js+repo:jquery/jquery`
   *
   * This query searches for the keyword `addClass` within a file's contents. The query limits the search to files where the language is JavaScript in the `jquery/jquery` repository.
   *
   * Considerations for code search:
   *
   * Due to the complexity of searching code, there are a few restrictions on how searches are performed:
   *
   * *   Only the _default branch_ is considered. In most cases, this will be the `master` branch.
   * *   Only files smaller than 384 KB are searchable.
   * *   You must always include at least one search term when searching source code. For example, searching for [`language:go`](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=language%3Ago&type=Code) is not valid, while [`amazing
   * language:go`](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=amazing+language%3Ago&type=Code) is.

   * Team synchronization is available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub's products](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products) in the GitHub Help documentation.
   *
   * If the user is already a member of the team's organization, this endpoint will add the user to the team. To add a membership between an organization member and a team, the authenticated user must be an organization owner or a team maintainer.
   *
   * > [!NOTE]
   * > When you have team synchronization set up for a team with your organization's identity provider (IdP), you will see an error if you attempt to use the API for making changes to the team's membership. If you have access to manage group membership in your IdP, you can manage GitHub Enterprise Server team membership through your identity provider, which automatically adds and removes team members in an organization. For more information, see "[Synchronizing teams between your identity provider and GitHub Enterprise Server](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.10/articles/synchronizing-teams-between-your-identity-provider-and-github/)."
   *
   * If the user is unaffiliated with the team's organization, this endpoint will send an invitation to the user via email. This newly-created membership will be in the "pending" state until the user accepts the invitation, at which point the membership will transition to the "active" state and the user will be added as a member of the team. To add a membership between an unaffiliated user and a team, the authenticated user must be an organization owner.
   *
   * If the user is already a member of the team, this endpoint will update the role of the team member's role. To update the membership of a team member, the authenticated user must be an organization owner or a team maintainer.

   * @description **Deprecated**: Use `repos.compareCommitsWithBasehead()` (`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/compare/{basehead}`) instead. Both `:base` and `:head` must be branch names in `:repo`. To compare branches across other repositories in the same network as `:repo`, use the format `<USERNAME>:branch`.
   *
   * The response from the API is equivalent to running the `git log base..head` command; however, commits are returned in chronological order. Pass the appropriate [media type](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/media-types/#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests) to fetch diff and patch formats.
   *
   * The response also includes details on the files that were changed between the two commits. This includes the status of the change (for example, if a file was added, removed, modified, or renamed), and details of the change itself. For example, files with a `renamed` status have a `previous_filename` field showing the previous filename of the file, and files with a `modified` status have a `patch` field showing the changes made to the file.
   *
   * **Working with large comparisons**
   *
   * To process a response with a large number of commits, you can use (`per_page` or `page`) to paginate the results. When using paging, the list of changed files is only returned with page 1, but includes all changed files for the entire comparison. For more information on working with pagination, see "[Traversing with pagination](/rest/guides/traversing-with-pagination)."
   *
   * When calling this API without any paging parameters (`per_page` or `page`), the returned list is limited to 250 commits and the last commit in the list is the most recent of the entire comparison. When a paging parameter is specified, the first commit in the returned list of each page is the earliest.
   *
   * **Signature verification object**
   *
   * The response will include a `verification` object that describes the result of verifying the commit's signature. The following fields are included in the `verification` object:
   *
   * | Name | Type | Description |
   * | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
   * | `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the signature in this commit to be verified. |
   * | `reason` | `string` | The reason for verified value. Possible values and their meanings are enumerated in table below. |
   * | `signature` | `string` | The signature that was extracted from the commit. |
   * | `payload` | `string` | The value that was signed. |
   *
   * These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:
   *
   * | Value | Description |
   * | ----- | ----------- |
   * | `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. |
   * | `not_signing_key` | The "signing" flag is not among the usage flags in the GPG key that made the signature. |
   * | `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with the signature verification service. |
   * | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is currently unavailable. |
   * | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. |
   * | `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in the commit. |
   * | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address in the commit. |
   * | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on her/his account. |
   * | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. |
   * | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been registered with any user's account. |
   * | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. |
   * | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. |
   * | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is considered to be verified. |
